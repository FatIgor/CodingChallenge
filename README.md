Spotted the above site mentioned on LinkedIn and thought it might be fun.

Did the first one, then decided to do them randomly.

(Google "pick random number between 1 and x" is very useful for deciding things if you decide to become a 21st century Luke Rhinehart.)

**Done so far:**
* 01 - wc
* 17 - MemCached

**Underway:**
* 08 - Redis

**To do:**
* Add tests
